name: Modules.Tizen.AttributeFilter
summary: AttributeFilter represents a filter based on an object attribute. 
description: |
    Represents the query statement for the specified value of the matchValue by the rule of 
    `matchFlag`. If no `matchValue` is defined, the filter will match all objects that have the 
    attribute defined (same as the <Modules.Tizen.FILTER_MATCH_FLAG_EXISTS> filter works), 
    otherwise, it will only match objects which have an attribute that matches the given value.
extends: Modules.Tizen.AbstractFilter

properties:
  - name: attributeName
    summary: The name of the object attribute used for filtering. 
    description: |
        This is the name of the object attribute exactly as it is defined in the object's interface. 
        For attributes of complex type, use fully-qualified names (such as 'organizations.role' to 
        filter on a contact's role in an organization). For attributes of an array type, the filter 
        will match if any value in the array matches.
    type: String

  - name: matchFlag
    summary: The match flag used for attribute-based filtering. 
    description: "By default, this attribute is set to <Modules.Tizen.FILTER_MATCH_FLAG_EXACTLY>."

    default: Modules.Tizen.FILTER_MATCH_FLAG_EXACTLY

  - name: matchValue
    summary: The value used for matching. 
    description: |
        The filter will match if the attribute value matches the given matchValue.
        This value is not used if the matchFlag is set to <Modules.Tizen.FILTER_MATCH_FLAG_EXISTS>. 
        By default, this attribute is set to null.

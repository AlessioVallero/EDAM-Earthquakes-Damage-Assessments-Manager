        To use this method, you must include the following privilege in the `tiapp.xml` file of your 
        Titanium application:

        * `http://tizen.org/privilege/application.launch`
        
    parameters:
      - name: id
        summary: A unique string representing application ID.
        type: String

      - name: callback
        summary: Function to invoke on success or failure.
        type: Callback<ErrorResponse>
        optional: true

  - name: launchAppControl
    summary: Launches an application with the specified application control. 
    description: |
        An application can launch other applications with the application control, and get back the 
        results from the launched applications. The application control consists of an operation, 
        URI, and MIME type, and describes the request to be performed by the newly launched 
        application. The application control is passed to the 
        [launchAppControl](Modules.Tizen.Apps.launchAppControl) method to launch an 
        application. The system tries to find the proper application to perform the requested 
        application control, then launches the selected application.
        
        The application control request is passed to the newly launched application and it can be 
        accessed by [getRequestedAppControl](Modules.Tizen.Apps.Application.getRequestedAppControl) 
        method. The passed application control contains the 
        reason the application was launched and information about what the application is doing. 
        The launched application can send a result to the caller application with the 
        [replyResult](Modules.Tizen.Apps.RequestedApplicationControl.replyResult) 
        method of the [RequestedApplicationControl](Modules.Tizen.Apps.RequestedApplicationControl) 
        interface.
        
        To use this method, you must include the following privilege in the `tiapp.xml` file of your 
        Titanium application:

            then the system tries to find the application to be launched for the requested 
            application control.

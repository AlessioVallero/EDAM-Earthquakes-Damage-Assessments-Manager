name: Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothSocket
summary: The interface to represent the Bluetooth socket.   
description: |
    The socket object is created by 
    [connectToServiceByUUID](Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothDevice.connectToServiceByUUID) or 
    [registerRFCOMMServiceByUUID](Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.registerRFCOMMServiceByUUID).
extends: Titanium.Proxy
createable: false
methods:

  - name: writeData
    summary: Writes data onto the socket. 
    description: |
        Writes a sequence of bytes onto the socket and returns the number of bytes actually written. 
        
        To use this method, you must include the following privilege in the `tiapp.xml` file of your 
        Titanium application:  

        * `http://tizen.org/privilege/bluetooth.spp`
        
    returns: 
      - type: Number
        summary: The number of bytes actually sent. 
    parameters: 
      - name: data
        summary: Data to send. 
        type: Array<Number>
 
  - name: readData
    summary: Reads data from the socket. 
    description: |
        This should be called only in the 'socketmessagereceived' handler, that is, when data is 
        ready on the socket. 
        
        To use this method, you must include the following privilege in the `tiapp.xml` file of your 
        Titanium application:  

        * `http://tizen.org/privilege/bluetooth.spp`
        
    returns: 
      - type: Array<Number>
        summary: Sequence of bytes successfully read. 

  - name: close
    summary: Closes the socket.  
    description: |
        Calling this method closes the socket. BluetoothSocket.state changes to 
        <Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BLUETOOTH_SOCKET_STATE_CLOSED>, and  'socketclosed' is invoked on 
        success.

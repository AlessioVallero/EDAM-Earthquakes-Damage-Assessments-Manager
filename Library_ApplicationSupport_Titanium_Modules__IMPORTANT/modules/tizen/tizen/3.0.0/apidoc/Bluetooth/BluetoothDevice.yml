name: Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothDevice
summary: The interface which represents a remote Bluetooth device.   
description: |
    This interface holds information about a remote device available on a local Bluetooth device, 
    such as device name, address, bonding status, etc.
    A BluetoothDevice object can be retrieved using one of the following APIs:

    - [getDevice](Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.getDevice)
    - [getKnownDevices](Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.getKnownDevices)
    - [createBonding](Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter.createBonding)

extends: Titanium.Proxy
createable: false
methods:

  - name: connectToServiceByUUID
    summary: Creates a socket connection to the specified service UUID.
    description: |
        This method attempts to open a connection to the service identified by uuid on this remote 
        device. This performs an SDP(Service Discovery Protocol) lookup on the local device for the 
        given uuid and determines which channel to use.
        
        If opening a connection is successful, then a BluetoothSocket object with open state is sent
        using callback, through which data can be exchanged by both devices.
        
        To use this method, you must include the following privilege in the `tiapp.xml` file of your
        Titanium application:  

        * `http://tizen.org/privilege/bluetooth.spp`

    parameters: 
      - name: uuid
        summary: 128 bit unique identifier, which represents the service record on the device.
        type: String

      - name: callback
        summary: Function to invoke on success or failure.
        type: Callback<ConnectToServiceByUUIDResponse>

properties:
  - name: name
    summary: The readable name of the device.
    type: String
    permission: read-only

  - name: address
    summary: The hardware address of the device. 
    type: String
    permission: read-only

  - name: deviceClass
    summary: The device class, which represents the type of the device and the services it provides.  
    type: Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothClass
    permission: read-only

  - name: isBonded
    summary: The bond state of the device with the local device.  
    type: Boolean
    permission: read-only

  - name: isTrusted
    summary: |
        The value is necessary to check if the local Bluetooth adapter recognizes the Bluetooth
        device as a trusted device. 
    type: Boolean
    permission: read-only

  - name: isConnected
    summary: The connection state of the Bluetooth device with the local Bluetooth adapter.     
    type: Boolean
    permission: read-only

    [connectToServiceByUUID](Modules.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothDevice.connectToServiceByUUID) method.
extends: ErrorResponse
properties:
  - name: success
    summary: Indicates if the operation succeeded.
    description: Returns `true` if request succeeded, `false` otherwise.
    type: Boolean

  - name: error
    summary: Error message, if any returned.
    description: Will be undefined if `success` is `true`.
    type: String

  - name: code
    summary: Error code. Returns 0 if `success` is `true`.
    description: |
        Error code will be 0 if `success` is `true`, nonzero otherwise. If the error

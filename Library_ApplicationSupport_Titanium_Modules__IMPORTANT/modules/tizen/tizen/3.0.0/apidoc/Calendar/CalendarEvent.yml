name: Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CalendarEvent
summary:  An interface that implements the calendarEvent object.
extends: Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CalendarItem
methods:
  - name: expandRecurrence
    summary: |
        This method takes into consideration all the parameters of the event recurrence rule to 
        generate the instances occurring in a given time interval.
    description: |
        The call involves retrieving from the database detached instances of an event to replace 
        their corresponding virtual instances in the returned list. 
        The client can then use CalendarEvent.isDetached attribute to identify detached instances.
        If the event is not saved to a calendar yet, only virtual instances will be returned.
        
        To use this method, you must include the following privilege in the `tiapp.xml` file of your 
        Titanium application:  

        * `http://tizen.org/privilege/calendar.read`
        
    parameters:
      - name: startDate
        summary:  The start date/ time of an event(inclusive).
        type: Date

      - name: endDate 
        summary:   The end date/ time of an event (inclusive).
        type: Date
        
      - name: callback
        summary: Function to invoke on success or failure.
        type: Callback<ExpandRecurrenceResponse>
  
properties:
  - name: isDetached 
    type: Boolean
    summary: |
        An attribute that behaves like a flag to indicate if an instance of a recurring event is 
        detached and if it has been modified and saved to the calendar.
    permission: read-only
    
  - name: endDate 
    type: Date
    summary: |
        An attribute to store the end date/time of an event.(see RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.2.2).
    description: |
        This endDate must be in the same time zone as the startDate. 
        Note that duration and endDate are mutually exclusive, only one of them can be non-null.
        
        This attribute is precise to the second. Milliseconds are ignored.
        
        The default value for this attribute is null.
        
  - name: availability
    type: String
    summary: |
        An attribute to indicate the availability of a person for an event. 
        (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.2.9).
    description: |
        The value is one of the constants defined for this parameter : 
        <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.EVENT_AVAILABILITY_BUSY> or 
        <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.EVENT_AVAILABILITY_FREE>.
        
        The default value is <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.EVENT_AVAILABILITY_BUSY>.
        
  - name: recurrenceRule 
    type: Date
    summary: |
        An attribute to denote the recurrence rule for the event.
    description: |        
        The generated instances of a recurring event will have the same recurrence rule as their 
        parent.
        This is useful when editing a particular event instance and choosing to update all instances 
        from it.
        
        The detached instances (specific instances that have been modified as saved to the calendar) 
        of a recurring event will not have any recurrence rule. 
        No recurrence rule can be set on detached instances either. If one tries to set a recurrence 
        rule on a detached event, 
        a NotSupportedError should be thrown. Detached instances can be distinguished by checking 
        their isDetached attribute. (See RFC 5545, Section 3.3.10.)

name: ExpandRecurrenceResponse
summary: |
    Simple object returned in the callback from the
    [expandRecurrence](Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CalendarEvent.expandRecurrence) method.
extends: ErrorResponse
properties:
  - name: success
    summary: Indicates if the operation succeeded.
    description: Returns `true` if request succeeded, `false` otherwise.
    type: Boolean

  - name: error
    summary: Error message, if any returned.
    description: Will be undefined if `success` is `true`.
    type: String

  - name: code
    summary: Error code. Returns 0 if `success` is `true`.
    description: |
        Error code will be 0 if `success` is `true`, nonzero otherwise. If the error
        was generated by the operating system, that system's error value is used.
        Otherwise, this value will be -1.
    type: Number

  - name: events
    summary:  The array of CalendarEvent objects.
    description: Will be undefined if `success` is `false`.
    type: Array<Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CalendarEvent>

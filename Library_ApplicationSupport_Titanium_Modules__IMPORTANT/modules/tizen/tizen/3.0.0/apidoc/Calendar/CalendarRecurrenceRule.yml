name: Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CalendarRecurrenceRule
summary: |
    This interface implements the CalendarRecurrenceRule object, which contains information about 
    the recurrence of an event. (See RFC 5545, Section 3.3.10.)
extends: Titanium.Proxy        
properties:
  - name: frequency 
    type: String
    summary: |
        An attribute to store the frequency of a recurrence rule.
    description: |
        This property corresponds to FREQ in RFC 5545.
        
        The value is one of the constants defined for this type:

        - <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_DAILY>
        - <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_WEEKLY>
        - <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_MONTHLY>
        - <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_YEARLY>
  
  - name: interval
    type: Number
    summary: |
        An attribute to specify how often the recurrence rule repeats over the unit of time 
        indicated by its frequency.
    description: |
        This attribute is linked to the frequency attribute and for a interval of n, 
        the event will recur every n of recurrence attribute.
        
        For example, if the interval attribute is set to 2 and frequency attribute is set to 
        <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_WEEKLY>, 
        then the event will recur every 2 weeks.
        
        The default interval value is 1, that is, every day if the CalendarRecurrenceRule frequency 
        attribute is <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_DAILY>, 
        every week if frequency is <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_WEEKLY>, every 
        month if frequency is <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_MONTHLY> or every 
        year if frequency is <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_YEARLY>.
        
        This property corresponds to INTERVAL in RFC 5545.
        
  - name: untilDate
    type: Date
    summary: |
        An attribute to indicate the end date of a recurrence duration of an event using either an 
        end date (`untilDate` attribute) or a number of occurrences (`occurrenceCount` attribute).
    description: |
        By default, this attribute is set to null, meaning that the event recurs infinitely, unless 
        `occurrenceCount` is set.
        This attribute is precise to the second. Milliseconds are ignored.
        
        This property corresponds to UNTIL in RFC 5545.
        
  - name: occurrenceCount
    type: Number
    summary: |
        An attribute to indicate the number of occurrences of a recurring event.
    description: |
        The recurrence duration of an event can be defined using either an end date (`untilDate` 
        attribute) or a number of occurrences (`occurrenceCount` attribute).
        By default, this attribute is set to -1, meaning that the event recurs infinitely, unless 
        `untilDate` is set.
        
        This property corresponds to COUNT in RFC 5545.
        
  - name: daysOfTheWeek
    type: Array<String>
    summary: |
        An attribute to store the days of the week associated with the recurrence rule.
    description: |
        This property value is valid only for recurrence rules with a frequency type of 
        <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_WEEKLY>, 
        <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_MONTHLY>, and 
        <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.RECURRENCE_RULE_FREQUENCY_YEARLY>.
        This property corresponds to BYDAY in RFC 5545.
        
        By default, this attribute is set to an empty array.
        
  - name: setPositions
    type: Array<Number>
    summary: |
        An attribute to store a list of ordinal numbers that filters which recurrences to include in 
        the recurrence rule's frequency.
    description: |
        For example, a yearly recurrence rule that has a daysOfTheWeek value that specifies Monday 
        through Friday, and a setPositions array containing 2 and -1, occurs only on the second 
        weekday and last weekday of every year.
        Values can be from 1 to 366 or -366 to -1. Negative values indicate counting backwards from 
        the end of the recurrence rule's frequency (week, month, or year).
        This attribute must only be used in conjunction with another BYxxx rule part 
        (such as daysOfTheWeek).
        This property corresponds to BYSETPOS in RFC 5545.
        
        By default, this attribute is set to an empty array
        
  - name: exceptions
    type: Array<Date>
    summary: |
        An attribute to list date/time exceptions for the recurring event. (See RFC 5545, 
        Section 3.8.5.1.)
    description: |
        This attribute is precise to the second. Milliseconds are ignored.
        This property corresponds to EXDATE in RFC 5545.
        
        By default, this attribute is set to an empty array.

name: Modules.Tizen.Messaging.Message
summary: Defines the content and attributes of a message. 
description: |
    This interface allows a web application to define the set of properties linked to a message.
    It also allows an application to retrieve the content of a message through the 
    <Modules.Tizen.Messaging.MessageStorage>
    methods. 
    In those cases, the implementation MAY return, in some situations, only the meta-information of 
    a message without the loaded body. 
    In those situations, the method 
    [loadMessageBody](Modules.Tizen.Messaging.MessageService.loadMessageBody)
    should be used.

        the first occasion that the message is processed by the underlying platform, such as a call 
        to [sendMessage](Modules.Tizen.Messaging.MessageService.sendMessage). Before the `id` is 
        assigned, it is set to null. By default, this attribute is set to null.

summary: Message creating, sending, and fetching capabilities. 
description: |
    This interface allows a web application to manipulate and send messages.
    The interface allows you to fetch messages for all folders belonging to one account, with 
    synchronizable flag set, using the [sync](Modules.Tizen.Messaging.MessageService.sync) method, 
    or for a given folder using the [syncFolder](Modules.Tizen.Messaging.MessageService.syncFolder) 
    method.
    The interface allows you to fetch the message body for a given message using the
    [loadMessageBody](Modules.Tizen.Messaging.MessageService.loadMessageBody) method.

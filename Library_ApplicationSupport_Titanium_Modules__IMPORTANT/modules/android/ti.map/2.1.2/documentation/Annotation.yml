<p>name: Modules.Map.Annotation
summary: Represents a labeled point of interest on the map that the user can click on.
description: |
    The <code>Annotation</code> object gives you low-level control over annotations that can be added to 
    <a href="Modules.Map.View">map view</a>. An annotation must have its <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code>
    properties set to appear on a map.</p>
<pre><code>An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation
is marked by a pin image. When the user selects the pin, the full annotation is 
displayed.

You can specify a custom image for the map pin by setting the
[image](Modules.Map.Annotation.image) property.

When the user clicks on an annotation, a `click` event is generated. The annotation
itself does not generate these events. You must add event listeners to the map view instead.

Use the &lt;Modules.Map.createAnnotation&gt; method to create an annotation.
